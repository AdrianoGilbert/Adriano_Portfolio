### Goal of Project:

- Demonstrates how to prepare raw data acquired from the web that needs Data Wrangling. 

- Focus on acquiring and preparing steps of Data Science workflow.

### Tools:

- Jupyter Notebook

- Python libraries: pandas and matplotlib

### Data source:

- [Wikipedia:Fundraising statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Fundraising_statistics)

### Workflow:

#### Step 1: Acquire

 - Importing libraries

`import pandas as pd`

`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`

`%matplotlib inline`

`url = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Fundraising_statistics'`

`table = pd.read_html(url)`

`data = table [0]`

`data.head()`

`del data['Source']`

`data.head()`

- Converting 'Year' column to numeric

All the strings in years are formatted: 'YYYY/YYYY';  we want to get the last year as a string, then convert that to numeric.

`data ['Year'] = data ['Year'].str[-4:]`

`data.head()`

![](Images/output5Year.png)

`data ['Year'] = pd.to_numeric (data ['Year'])`

`data.dtypes`

- Setting 'Year' to index
