# Project 2:

## Web Scraping and Data Wrangling with Python

![Data Science Workflow](Images/ds-workflow.png)


### Goal of Project:

- Demonstrates how to prepare raw data acquired from the web that needs Data Wrangling. 

- Focus on acquiring and preparing steps of Data Science workflow.

### Tools:

- Jupyter Notebook

- Python libraries: pandas and matplotlib

### Data source:

- [Wikipedia:Fundraising statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Fundraising_statistics)

### Workflow:

#### Step 1: Acquire

 - Importing libraries

`import pandas as pd`

`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`

`%matplotlib inline`

- Retrieving and reading the data

`url = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Fundraising_statistics'`

`table = pd.read_html(url)`

`data = table [0]`

`data.head()`

![output1](Images/output1.png)


#### Step 2: Prepare

- Looking for null (missing) values

`data.isna().any()`
![](Images/output2Null.png)


- Checking the data types

`data.dtypes`

![](Images/output3Types.png)

- Deleting the Source Column

Since 'Source' column has no values for futher analysis it was deleted.

`del data['Source']`

`data.head()`

![](Images/output4DeletingColumn.png)

- Converting 'Year' column to numeric

All the strings in years are formatted: 'YYYY/YYYY';  we want to get the last year as a string, then convert that to numeric.

`data ['Year'] = data ['Year'].str[-4:]`

`data.head()`

![](Images/output5Year.png)

`data ['Year'] = pd.to_numeric (data ['Year'])`

`data.dtypes`

![](Images/output6ConvertNum.png)

- Setting 'Year' to index

`data.set_index('Year', inplace=True)`

`data.sort_index(inplace=True)`

`data`

![](Images/output7IndexSort.png)

- Converting the remaining columns to numeric

`data ['Revenue'] = pd.to_numeric(data ['Revenue'].str[2:].str.replace(',', ''))`

`data ['Expenses'] = pd.to_numeric(data ['Expenses'].str[2:].str.replace(',', ''))`

`data ['Asset rise'] = pd.to_numeric(data ['Asset rise'].str[2:].str.replace(',', ''))`

`data ['Total assets'] = pd.to_numeric(data ['Total assets'].str[2:].str.replace(',', ''))`

`data.dtypes`

![](Images/output8CovertNum.png)

- Visualizing data to investigate quality

`data [['Revenue', 'Expenses', 'Total assets']].plot()`

![](Images/output9Viz.png)

`data ['Asset rise'].plot()`
